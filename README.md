# first-website
This repository is going to be the repo for my first website! This is starting on project odin, in the foundation section. The main focus on this website is to understand and get a feel for using flexbox, css, and html together. This exercise helped me understand how to properly use flexbox and how I would like my layouts to look. I will come back to this project in the future, but my primary focus was just building the site and getting all the filler content where I wanted it to go. SS
